    //iNTRODUCTION TO TREES
    //A tree is hierichial data structure consisting of nodes
    //with a root node at the top and child nodes below it
    //trees are widely used in applicatioon such as databases etc.
    //types of trees
    //binary tree:each node has at most two children left and right
    //Binary search tree where left child<parent and right child>parent
    //balanced type of binary tree where the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by at most 1
    //problem 102 leetcode
    //GIven an binary tree return the level order traversal of its nodes values
    //aproach use a queue to store the nodes at each level for bfs traversal
